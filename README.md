# Stereo-Pair-Generator
This program is intended to have comprehensive documentation for the creation of a Satellite Image Stereo Pair generator. This program reverses the process of stereo image pairs from a single Ortho-Corrected satellite image.

This was designed to work specifically with Python, leveraging image processing libraries such as PIL.

# Features
The Stereo Pair Generator program creates a 'flat' image from an Ortho-Corrected satellite image, thus simulating different baseline distances which is beneficial for depth analysis
The most useful application of this enables users to analyze satellite images at various viewpoints without the need to take multiple image captures.

# Usage
Currently, the Stereo Pair Generator program is incomplete due to time constraints in the project. However, the development team has written extensive documentation regarding usage. 

To use, simply navigate to the file directory and execute the main.py python file. The results will be printed to the command line, and a new 'flat' image will be automatically placed in your downloads folder. 

The satellite image and depth field being processed is hard-coded into the program. To use custom images, the user will need to enter a file editor and direct the program to use different files.

# Lessons Learned
One of the biggest lessons learned was how to apply Agile development practices to a real world project. Agile practices were leveraged to maintain adaptability and meet project milestones efficiently. I also gained further knowledge with how to process images and write complex programs using Python. The formulas and algorithms used were complex, and it was a learning curve getting them to run efficiently on a language that is stereotypically considered to be slow. Lastly, I developed more problem solving solutions for issues involving baseline adjustments and disparity calculations. These were complex challenges and took the team some time to find an appropriate solution.
